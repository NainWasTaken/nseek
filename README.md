# Nseek
A fun little hide and seek datapack game with shrinking borders. Recommended to play with 3 or more people.

> NOTE: Currently I have no plans for making big contributions to it as I mostly have stopped playing the game, I will update it if it's needed but for now it will stay stale. It was last tested in MC java version 1.20.1

## How to use
To start a game run
```/function nseek:startgame``` 

To end a current game run
```/function nseek:endgame```

In case you need to reload it, run
```/function nseek:load```

To configure the game settings run
```/function nseek:settings```
